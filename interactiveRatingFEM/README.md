## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to use querySelectorAll and a for loop in JS to add an event listener to multiple elements at once. While this is not a brand new skill for me, it still took some time for me to write the code out without errors.

I also learned about using an aria-label to give more context to a screen reader where it may be necessary. I hope to get some feedback on my use of an aria-label in my solution.
