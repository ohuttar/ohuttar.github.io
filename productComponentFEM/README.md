## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

Additionally, I tried to solve the challenge by myself at first, and then to compare my solution to Kevin Powell's solution to hopefully learn some useful things from him.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

My 3 most useful takeaways:

1. Using grid/custom properties to efficiently space content
2. Include all meaningful content in HTML (not pseudo-elements, for accessibility concerns)
3. Using a <picture> tag allows you to set multiple sources for one img

### Useful resources

## Acknowledgments

I've been learning a ton from Kevin Powell's Youtube channel. In my initial attempt at this challenge, I tried my best to emulate his practices. Afterwards I compared my solution to his, and made adjustments to follow his process. As a result, my solution is virtually identical to his.
