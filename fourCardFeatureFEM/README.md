## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://ohuttar.github.io/fourCardFeatureFEM/index.html](https://ohuttar.github.io/fourCardFeatureFEM/index.html)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

This project was perfect for practicing using grid. I have been watching some of Kevin Powell's videos on getting started with grid (his YT channel is linked below) and I was able to use his tips directly on this challenge. Particularly, he recommended to avoid setting grid-template-rows unless absolutely necessary. I think I was able to achieve the layout with minimal code. 

I've also been trying to be more discerning about how to organize HTML and what deserves to be a heading/paragraph/etc. I made the choice to have the text above the cards to be paragraphs. Although they are visually styled as headings, I thought that they didn't make sense as headings. I'm not sure I have a great sense for these things yet, but I'm learning. 

I tried to be a bit more perfectionist on this challenge than in some previous challenges, so there are some oddly specific numbers here and there, but at the end I don't want to be unpractical for the sake of pixel-perfection. 

### Continued development

If I receive helpful comments and tips, I will update my solution. Thanks for reading!
